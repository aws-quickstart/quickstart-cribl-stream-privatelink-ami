.Partner Solution architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones in your virtual private cloud (VPC).
* An Application Load Balancer to route user web traffic to Cribl Stream instances.
* A PrivateLink VPC endpoint to allow private access to Cribl Stream to other AWS accounts.
* A Network Load Balancer to route traffic from the PrivateLink VPC endpoint to Cribl Stream worker nodes in the public subnets.
* In the public subnets:
** A Cribl Stream leader node deployed to an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance in an Auto Scaling group.*
** Cribl Stream worker nodes deployed to Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group.*
* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for a role and policy for the Cribl Stream instances. After deploying the Quick Start, you can customize it by adding data sources to the IAM policy.

[.small]#* By default, to give users a better experience when getting started with Cribl Stream, this Quick Start deploys in a public subnet. If you're deploying this Quick Start in a production environment, consider using a private subnet.#
