.Partner Solution architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture-diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones in your VPC.
* An Application Load Balancer to route user web traffic to Cribl Stream instances.
* A PrivateLink VPC endpoint for private access to the Partner Solution VPC from other AWS accounts.
* A Network Load Balancer to route traffic from the PrivateLink VPC endpoint to Cribl Stream worker nodes in the public subnets.
* In the public subnets, a Cribl Stream leader node and two worker nodes in Auto Scaling groups. Each node is deployed to an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance.*
* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for a role and policy for the Cribl Stream instances.

[.small]#* By default, to give users a better experience when getting started with Cribl Stream, this Partner Solution deploys in a public subnet. If you're deploying this Partner Solution to a production environment, consider using a private subnet.#
